We designed and built a basketball throwing robot capable of both dribbling and shooting the basketball autonomously. The robot uses image processing (IP) techniques for ball detection, enabling it to recognize and track the ball in real-time as it maneuvers and prepares to shoot. My primary contributions to this project included handling all the circuital connections and ensuring reliable and efficient power distribution throughout the robot's systems. This involved designing the wiring layout, integrating power supplies, and troubleshooting electrical issues to guarantee the robotâ€™s sensors, actuators, and control units functioned seamlessly together.
